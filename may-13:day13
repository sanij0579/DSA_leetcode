3335. Total Characters in String After Transformations I

solution:
class Solution:

        MOD = 10**9 + 7

        freq = [0] * 26
        for c in s:

            for i in range(25):
                # Characters 'a' to 'y' shift to next character
                new_freq[i + 1] = freq[i]
            # 'z' contributes to both 'a' and 'b'
            new_freq[0] = freq[25]
            new_freq[1] = (new_freq[1] + freq[25]) % MOD
